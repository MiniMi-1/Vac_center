# Vac_center

Web app that simulates a vaccination center made for a university test.
Developed using Servlets, JSPs and Beans following a MVC approach.
As the app was developed in 2 weeks i'm aware of its shortcomings and I want to make it better when I have time to do so.

Things to change:

-CSS (the test focused on the logic and not on the look so i didn't focus on it at all)
-Using relative paths instead of absolute ones
-Moving the JSPs in WEB-INF
